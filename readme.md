# Ionic UI Explorer

Research and discovery project to build an interactive web component that can parse CSS variables and shadow parts from slotted content. This tool would allow developers to have an interactive example to update CSS variables to see the direct effects in the example app. It would also allow developers to select shadow parts to better understand theming capabilities within a web component.
